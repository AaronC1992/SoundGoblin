## The Problem

Tabletop RPG game masters spend hours curating playlists and manually triggering sound effects mid-session. It breaks immersion, splits focus, and most groups just skip audio entirely.

## The Solution

SoundGoblin listens to what's happening at the table and **automatically** plays the right sounds at the right time — no manual input needed.

- A player says *"I kick down the tavern door"* — tavern ambiance fades in
- The DM describes a thunderstorm — rain and thunder start rolling
- Combat breaks out — the music shifts to battle drums

The GM stays in the story. The players stay immersed. The audio just works.

## How It Works

SoundGoblin uses **speech recognition** to capture live conversation, sends it through an **AI analysis layer** (GPT-4o-mini), and maps the output to a curated library of **450+ sound effects and ambient tracks** — all in real time.

```
Voice Input → Speech Recognition → AI Context Analysis → Sound Matching → Playback
```

### Key Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Auto-Detect Mode** | Listens to live speech and triggers sounds automatically via AI |
| **Story Mode** | Pre-written narrative scenes with timed audio cues |
| **Sound Library** | 450+ categorized sounds — ambient, combat, weather, creatures, music |
| **Control Board** | Manual triggers for GMs who want direct control alongside auto-detect |
| **Smart Layering** | Multiple sounds play simultaneously with intelligent volume balancing |
| **Instant Response** | Sub-second latency from spoken word to audio playback |

## Market Opportunity

The tabletop RPG market has grown into a **$2B+ industry** (2025), fueled by actual-play content (Critical Role, Dimension 20) and the mainstreaming of D&D. Supporting tools — VTTs, digital maps, audio — are a fast-growing adjacent segment.

**No product on the market offers real-time, voice-reactive audio.**

Current alternatives require manual playlist management (Syrinscape, Tabletop Audio) or pre-configured triggers. SoundGoblin is the first to close the loop between spoken narrative and dynamic audio — zero-touch.

### Target Users

- **Game Masters** running in-person or online TTRPG sessions
- **Actual-play streamers & podcasters** looking for production-quality audio
- **Game cafes & event organizers** hosting RPG nights
- **LARP & immersive experience designers**

## Tech Stack
